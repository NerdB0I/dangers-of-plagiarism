                    So, what is Copyright? And how does it differ from Plagiarism? Well, both involve 
                    stealing someone else's work as your own. For example, if you take a TV character 
                    and use it for your own profit, that is illegal by copyright. If you take someone's 
                    words and research and pass it off as your own, that is academic dishonesty, or
                    plagiarism. The main difference is that copyright is illegal, and applies to works 
                    like music, games, etc. Plagiarism is not illegal, and applies mostly to words from 
                    others, such as quotes, research, or otherwise.

                    Now, the idea of copyright is good. It protects people's original works, so that's 
                    a good thing. My problem with it is that it can get too far. Let's say you want to 
                    use some musical themes from a game you played for something you make. Well, copyright 
                    stops that. The most recent example that comes to my mind is Undertale Yellow. Now, 
                    Undertale is a game from 2015, and it is well known for having many, many, many fangames 
                    and remixes for it's songs. Undertale Yellow came out in 2023, and like most fangames; 
                    it remixes songs or uses similar themes in the music. Well, people like to record themselves 
                    playing games for YouTube. Materia Publishing, the music publishing/copyright team for Undertale, saw this, 
                    heard that the music was based off of Undertale, and proceeded to copyright strike  
                    videos about the game, even going so far to question the fangame's creator about it's 
                    legitimacy. The game is free and was made as a passion project, and keep in mind the creator 
                    of Undertale itself has said before that making fan music or fangames is A-Okay with him. 
                    They even changed the FAQ just to suit their arguements. 
                    Point being; copyright had a bit too far of a reach here. The music was original, with  
                    similarities of course, free, and was even given an OK by the original game's developer.

                    How should this be handled? Unfortunately, the fix isn't as simple as one would think. 
                    You still need to protect people's works, and clearly here the methods of limiting the 
                    reach (Fair Use or Parody) failed. So, what should the solution be? This would be more 
                    of a legal thing to occur, but; The owner should be able to allow certain things to 
                    bypass the traditional copyright laws. For example, Toby Fox would allow people legally 
                    to remix the game's music, make fangames, record these things, etc., without dealing with 
                    copyright hassle. This would solve quite a few problems Like the Undertale Yellow situation, 
                    along with others like "What circumstances can our company logo be used?" (Movies), or 
                    "Can other people show our characters?" (Crossovers for shows).
