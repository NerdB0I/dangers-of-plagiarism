So unless you open this on github (or use your OWN file editor) you won't see this.
However I feel as though I should, explain;

> I know how to code websites already.

Actually, it's one of my hobbies. Usually for games that never see the light of day (or get finished), but still a hobby of mine. 
I know you wanted us to use that editor... buttt that's boring. I'm gonna use [VS Code](https://vscode.dev), which is the web version of the editor I typically use.
Once it's all done, I'll simply download the entire folder and send it like that. Enjoy! 

- P.S., to open the site, open index.html
