                    states plagiarism is "Presenting work or ideas from another source
                    as your own ... by incorporating it into your work without full acknowledgement." 
                    When you plagiarize, you are simply <em>lying.</em> You are essentially saying, 
                    "Hey, I did all of this work on my own," when in fact, no you did not. It is 
                    unethical and in academics, will fail your assignment.
